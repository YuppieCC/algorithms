## Reverse String
	
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

```
Example 1:
Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```
```
Example 2:
Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

## Reverse Integer

Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.
```
Example 1:
Input: 123
Output: 321
```
```
Example 2:
Input: -123
Output: -321
```
```
Example 3:
Input: 120
Output: 21
```

Note:

 Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

## Index 

Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return it's index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.

```
Examples:
s = "leetcode"
return 0.

s = "loveleetcode",
return 2.
```

Note: You may assume the string contain only lowercase letters.

## Valid Anagram

Given two strings s and t , write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s.
```
Example 1:
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```
```
Example 2:
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```

Note: You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.
Follow up: What if the inputs contain unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such case?

## Valid Palindrome

Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

Note: For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.

```
Example 1:
Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
```
```
Example 2:
Input: "race a car"
Output: false
```
