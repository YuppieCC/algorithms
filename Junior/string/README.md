## Reverse String
	
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

```
Example 1:
Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```
```
Example 2:
Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

## Reverse Integer

Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.
```
Example 1:
Input: 123
Output: 321
```
```
Example 2:
Input: -123
Output: -321
```
```
Example 3:
Input: 120
Output: 21
```

Note:

 Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

## Index 

Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return it's index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.

```
Examples:
s = "leetcode"
return 0.

s = "loveleetcode",
return 2.
```

Note: You may assume the string contain only lowercase letters.
